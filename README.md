## 🔥 Behind the Scenes

Remember playing quick, strategic games with your friends in school? This finger cricket game was a favorite among thousands of students in Kerala, played with just hands and sharp thinking. Years later, while learning to code, I dreamed of building games that challenge the mind. That’s how **Classic Cricket** was born—a digital version of the game that brings back the fun, now on your screen!

I initially built a **[terminal version](https://github.com/malik-l0l/Cricket/blob/main/Cricket/cricket.py)** of the game and later developed a **[GUI version using Tkinter](https://github.com/malik-l0l/Cricket/blob/main/Cricket_GUI/cricket_gui.py)** to make it more interactive and engaging.
